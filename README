Ignited DataTables MySQL Helper is a library for Code Igniter to help you work with DataTables.

It allows you to write your own MySQL query and then it modifies your query so that it adds the filter, sort by, and limit features of DataTables.

All you have to do is write a query that it will use that along with the DataTable’s $_POST variables to create a RecordSet you can turn into JSON later.
It will also give you the iTotalRecords and iTotalDisplayRecords for your response.
